== Frequently asked questions ==

= I got problem with Instagram =

It's a known issue due to Instagram. Twitter said it recently : Users are experiencing issues with viewing Instagram photos on Twitter. Issues include cropped images.This is due to Instagram disabling its Twitter cards integration, and as a result, photos are being displayed using a pre-cards experience. 
So, when users click on Tweets with an Instagram link, photos appear cropped.

= Plugin is fine but Twitter cards doesn't appear in my tweets =

1. Make sure you correctly fulfilled fields in option page according to [Twitter documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards "Twitter cards documentation")
2. Make sure you have correctly [submitted your website to Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator "Twitter cards submit")
3. Wait for Twitter's answer (a mail that tells you your site has been approved)
4. Be careful with your robots.txt and put some rules to allow Twitter to fetch your website :

`	
	User-agent: Twitterbot
	Disallow:
`

If it still doesn't work please open a thread on support.

= Use of new feature product cards =

Just activate meta box, select **card type product** and save draft. 4 new fields will appear and you'll be able to set your product card.

= The plugin generates a lot of images (different sizes) =

I can be a problem when you work with HD and/or a lot of images.

**How do I use the custom fields option?**

Basically you provide your custom field keys in plugin option page and then it will grab datas.

= How do I use gallery cards ? =

Just use the WordPress media manager to set a WordPress Gallery and the plugin will grab the first 4 images to set the gallery card. You have to use the shortcode [gallery] to enjoy this feature ( that's what the WordPress media manager does, it inserts the shortcode [gallery]).

**Please avoid using images heavier than 1 MB.**

= I get a fatal error ! =

`Call to undefined function cmb_metabox_form()` >> if you get this it's not due to the plugin it comes from another plugin or a theme using the same framework for meta boxes but in a very old version.
So do not yell at me ^^

= Problème avec Instagram =
C'est un problème connu. Cela vient d'Instagram lui-même qui préfère que ses utilisateurs partagent les photos chez lui plutôt que sur Twitter. Instagram a supprimé ses Twitter Cards.

= Le plugin marche mais je n'obtiens pas de Twitter Cards dans mes tweets =

1. Assurez-vous bien d'avoir rempli correctement les champs dans la page d'options suivant <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards" title="Twitter cards documentation">la documentation Twitter</a>
2. Assurez-vous bien d'avoir <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator" title="Twitter cards formulaire de validation">soumis votre site à Twitter</a>
3. Attendez la réponse de Twitter (un mail qui vous indique que votre site a été approuvé)
4. Attention avec le fichier robots.txt, vous devez autoriser le robot de Twitter à crawler votre site:

`
	User-agent: Twitterbot
	Disallow:
`

Si cela ne marche toujours pas SVP ouvrez un topic sur le support.

= Utilisez la nouvelle card product =

Activez la meta box et sélectionnez **le type product** pour la card. Sauvez le brouillon et 4 champs apparaîtront pour mettre en place la card product.

= Le plugin génère beaucoup trop de fichiers images = 

Cela peut poser problème si vous travaillez avec de la HD et/ou beaucoup d'images. Vous pouvez donc utiliser un plugin qui va effacer les fichiers images non utilisés.

= Comment utiliser l'option custom fields? =

Il suffit de renseigner les clés de vos custom fields en page d'option et le plugin s'occupera de récupérer les datas correspondantes.

= Comment mettre en place des cards galerie ? =

Utiliser le gestionnaire de médias WordPress pour créer une galerie WordPress et le plugin prendra les 4 premières pour constituer la card galerie.
Vous devez utiliser le shortcode [gallery] pour obtenir une card galerie (c'est ce que fait le gestionnaire de médias, il insère le shortcode [gallery]).

*SVP évitez d'utliser des images de plus d'1 MB*.

= Hey j'ai une fatal error ! =

`Call to undefined function cmb_metabox_form()` : ça vient d'un thème ou d'un plugin qui use du même framework pour ses meta boxes mais dans une version très ancienne, donc ne me criez pas dessus ^^


== Screenshots ==
1. admin
2. confirmation mail
3. meta box
4. player cards validator ( I did not apply for player cards cause I do not have SSL )
5. gallery cards validator
6. preview in meta box

== Changelog ==

= 5.4.2 =
* 02 Jan 2015

* Refactoring code
* Delete messy parts of it
* Kinda MVC structure
* Fix missing translations for documentation
* Remove useless functions from main file and put them into JM_TC_Init class
* No needs for inheritance actually, not even logical, options cannot inherit from utitilities 
* Get post object from get_queried_object() in markup class - seems safer considering global $post often get screwed

* Small fixes on admin CSS

* 12 Oct 2014
* Better PHP documentation

* The fix can be done in the next update but I encourage you to migrate from PHP 5.2 to 5.3 in any case
* Improve User interface by splitting admin into pages : only important settings, the plugin does a lot of checking on its own
* Rebuild the entire code for maintenance
